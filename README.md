Tweens in Godot 4 have been totally overhauled from Godot 3. They've been changed from being node based to being entirely instantiated in code.

Tweens in Godot are perfect for small animations or performing procedurally generated animations. 
I'm using them in my FPS project to drive a substantial number of procedural animations, platforms and more. In this video I will show you how to create a simple Tween and then we will delve into more complex senarios.
